# GoKartElectronics
A repository hub for all the micro-electronics in the NM(tm pending) gokart

the [plan.md](https://github.com/MasterCubo/GoKartElectronics/blob/main/plan.md) file has all the info, ideas, and brainstorms for all the microcontroller related things on the gokart.

the [Mower Logic Diagram](https://github.com/MasterCubo/GoKartElectronics/blob/main/Mower%20Logic%20Diagram.png) file contains a screenshot of a [logic.ly](https://logic.ly) diagram that i had to pay $59 to save, so i decided to screenshot it instead. It only takes about a minute to recreate. I did that all mentally and it made me feel like a genius. [I tried to recreate it in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/385964986603062273), but it BARELY works.
